>
> If you want to stop your RStudio interactive tool, once you finish your R treatment and if relevant, saving your RStudio environment in your Galay history, you can proceed in 2 different ways:
> > Deleting the corresponding history dataset named `RStudio` and showing a "in progress state", so yellow.
> > Clicking on the "User" menu at the top and go to "Active InteractiveTools" and locate the RStudio instance you started, ticking the corresponding box so you can finally click on the "Stop" button.
