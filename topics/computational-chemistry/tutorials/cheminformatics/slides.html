### What is cheminformatics?
- Application of computational methods to chemical problems
- Emphasis on manipulation of structural information

---

### Representation of structures
- 2D: representation as molecular graph (e.g. SMILES or InChI)
- 3D: all three-dimensional coordinates recorded (e.g. SDF)

---

### SMILES format
- Rings indicated with numerals, e.g. cyclohexane is C1CCCCC1
- Aromaticity indicated with small letters e.g. benzene is c1ccccc1

---

### SDF format
- 3D format
- Contain multiple structures, separated by four dollar signs ($$$$)
- Each structure is encoded in MOL formats

---

### MOL format
- Lists all atoms
- Atomic coordinates
- Connections between atoms (bonds)
- Multiple structures are combined to form as SD-file

---
### InChI
- 'International Chemical Identifier'
- Files contain 'layers' of information - 2D
- Only compulsory layer: chemical formula
- Others: charge, stereochemistry, isotopes etc.

---
### PDB
- 3D Format used by the Protein Data Bank
- Used primarily for large macromolecules e.g. proteins

--- 
### Others
- See the molecular dynamics tutorial for more information of file types such as GRO, DCD, XTC
