Surface processes play a key role in **extreme events** (heat waves, fires, crop failures, floods, droughts).

# What is FATES?

FATES stands for the **Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator** and
is a module with fully **open-source** development:

![FATES](../../images/FATES_NGEET.png)
---

## FATES open-source

- Available on GitHub: [https://github.com/NGEET/fates](https://github.com/NGEET/fates)


It is designed to operate in a **"host"** land surface model, which simulates:
- plant physiology,
- competitive processes,
- ecosystem assembly
and
- vegetation distribution

---

## Cohort model

TODO: Add video showing cohort model concept

---

## Balanced ecological realism

What are the advances allowed by a demographic model?

- Representation of light competition & ecosystem assembly.
- Prediction of the distribution of plants based on their **functional traits**.
- **Lags** between climate and vegetation change and growth after **disturbances**.
- Better representation of **physiological processes** (hydraulics, fire, nutrients)

# Open source, community development

**Growth in participation in FATES**

![FATES community](../../images/FATES_community.png)

---
FATES development:
- About 39 funded researchers
- 6 countries, 26+ institutions
- 130 participants at the recent planning meeting
- 3 Earth System Modelling Centres
- More than 11 proposal funded (2020). Many more ongoing.

## FATES reduced complexity modes

# But that's not all...

FATES, (in common with all land surface models that are part of ESMs) remains technically challenging to run. 
- Scripting environment is complicated
- Porting model to a new supercomputer is incredibly hard.  
- Running at single sites or regions is more cumbersome than running globally
- Tools developed on one platform often do not work on another
- Workflows are complicated by computing architecture. 

---

# But that's not all...

**Interesting science** is at the interface of the input parameters, model processes and emergent outcomes.

# How can I use FATES in Galaxy?

- With CLM-FATES [Galaxy tool](https://galaxyproject.org/tools/) for running operational and long simulations.
- [Galaxy climate JupyterLab](https://live.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=interactive_tool_climate_notebook){:target="_blank"}
  for learning, developing the model, setting up simulations and visualizing results.
