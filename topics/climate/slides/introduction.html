# What we mean by "Climate"?

![](../images/word_cloud.png)

To make sure we all have the same understanding:

*According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate), Climate is defined as the **average state** of everyday’s weather condition **over a period of 30 years**. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.*

# Types of climate data resources

- Observations
- Re-analyses
- Climate models

We have very little actual observations at the scale of climate and usually not covering a large area. 

The type of climate data you will be using greatly depends on the period of time you are interested in.

# Observations

## Direct observations

These are measurements (from ground stations, buoys, satellites, etc.) of one or more physical variables (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) at one or more particular times and places.

## Indirect observations

They are derived from other observations:
- ice cores
- lake sediments
- tree rings

These are sometimes referred to as "climate proxies"

# Models

Numerical models are a mathematical representation of the climate developed by scientists to understand and predict the climate system.

## Re-analyses

A climate re-analysis is produced by combining numerical models with observations so it can only provide information about the past climate. It contains estimates of the air temperature, wind at different altitudes, rainfall, soil moisture content, etc.
The estimates are produced for all locations on earth, and they span a long time period that can extend back decades or more.


## Climate models

Various types of models are used for different aspects of the climate. 
All have different ways to represent the real world, depending on how researchers prioritize and perform these simplifications (in terms of parameterizations, etc.) in the numerical climate model.

## How good are climate models?

Climate models are improving but have "biases" so we usually do not use one model only but severals that we combine together: the collective results give a better overview of the real world than any single model.

## Climate prediction *vs.* projection

### Climate prediction

A **climate prediction** (or climate forecast) is an attempt to produce an estimate of the actual evolution of the natural climate in the future, for example, at seasonal, inter-annual or long-term time scales. 

### Climate projections

**Climate projections** are distinct from climate predictions in that projections depend upon emission/concentration/radiative forcing **scenarios**, which are based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.

Within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), now in its 6th phase, project simulations of the research community provide model output that will fuel climate research and climate impact studies for the next 5 to 10 years, while its careful analysis will form the basis for future climate assessments

# Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP)


**= societal development pathway**

The SSPs were developed as a joint community effort and describe global developments that
together would lead to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
SSPs comprise **five alternative** narratives that describe the main characteristics of the
pathways in qualitative terms as well as quantitative descriptions for key elements including
population, economic growth and urbanization.

Different pathways are defined by the magnitude of the challenges a future society
would face in adapting to or mitigating climate change if that socioeconomic pathway was pursued.

# Where to start to get climate data?

*There is a wealth of data and information available on the **web** about the past, current and future climate.*

**Not all of it is up-to-date and trustworthy**

- Check the provenance and data provider credentials

**Not all the variables/parameters are necessarily relevant for your study**

- Prioritize the use of [Essential Climate Variables](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/about) (as we know they critically contribute to the characterization of Earth’ s climate).

**Not all the variables are reliable**

- For instance, temperature is usually reliable but precipitation is more difficult to estimate
- Prioritize observations and re-analyses for past climate

**Prefer authoritative data providers**
