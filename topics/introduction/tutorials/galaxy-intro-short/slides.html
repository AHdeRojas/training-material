# Why use Galaxy?

- It is **easy**!
    - No installation, all you need is a browser.
    - No complex commands, just point and click!


- **Cross-domain**: bioinformatics, chemistry, ecology, climate science, ..

???

Data analysis can be very complex.

It often requires specialized programming knowledge or command line skills.

Galaxy makes this a lot easier by providing a graphical user interface to popular data analysis tools.

Galaxy is web based. This means you don't have to install anything, just open your browser and go to Galaxy.

Galaxy supports many different scientific domains.

# Find a Galaxy server

- **The Big Three**: Galaxy Main ([usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org)), Galaxy Europe ([usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)), Galaxy Australia ([usegalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au))

  .image-75[![usegalaxy.* servers]({{site.baseurl}}/shared/images/usegalaxy_servers.png)]


- Many other smaller domain-specific Galaxies available (125+)
 - List of all Galaxies: https://galaxyproject.org/use/

???
There are three main Galaxy servers. Galaxy Main, Galaxy Europe, and Galaxy Australia.

These three Galaxies have the biggest teams behind them, and offer the most tools and resources.

You can register an account for free on any of these servers.

In addition, there are many smaller galaxy servers to choose from.

Many of these are domain specific. For example, Galaxy proteomics focuses on proteomics tools and workflows.
