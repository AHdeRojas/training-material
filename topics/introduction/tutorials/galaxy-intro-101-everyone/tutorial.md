# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

This practical aims to familiarize you with the Galaxy user interface. 
It will teach you how to perform basic tasks such as importing data, running tools, working with histories, creating workflows, and sharing your work.
Not everyone has the same background and that's ok!

The Galaxy interface consists of three main parts:

1. The available tools are listed on the left
2. Your analysis history is recorded on the right
3. The central panel will let you run analyses and view outputs

![Galaxy ecosystem]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link shared/images/galaxy_interface.png %})


# Create a history

Galaxy allows you to create histories. Overall a history represents an experimental lab book, or a recipe very much like a cooking recipe with a list of ingredients (datasets) and a set of instructions 
(pipeline of operations) that describes how to prepare or make something (such as a plot, or even a new dataset).
The order of operations is important as very often the next operation takes as input the result of the previous operations. For instance, when baking
a cake, you would first sift flour and then mix it with eggs as it would be impossible to sift flour afterwards.
That is what we call a pipeline.

Then the finalized pipeline can be serialized as a workflow.A workflow is the concatenation of one or multiple histories as a series of building blocks 
for replicating an experimental result or a recipe. If we use cooking as an analogy, a workflow could represent an entire menu with all the recipes for each meal.
In other words, using a workflow makes it possible to apply the same procedure to a different dataset, just by changing the input.

## Upload Iris dataset

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Data upload
>
> 1. Import `iris.csv` from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1319069/files/iris.csv) or from the data library (ask your instructor)
>
>    ```
>    https://zenodo.org/record/1319069/files/iris.csv
>    ```
>
>    {% include snippets/import_via_link.md %}
>    {% include snippets/import_from_data_library.md %}
>
>    As default, Galaxy takes the link as name, so rename them.
>
> 2. Rename the dataset to `iris`
>
>    {% include snippets/rename_dataset.md %}
>
> 3. Check the datatype. The datatype of the iris dataset is `csv`. Change datatype
> if it is different then `csv`.
>
>    {% include snippets/change_datatype.md datatype="datatypes" %}
>
> 4. Add the tag `iris` to the dataset

# Pre-processing

A pre-processing step can be required to proceed analysis. In this case, format convertion and header removal have to be processed.


## Convert dataset **csv_to_tabular**

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Converting dataset format 
>    
>    * Click on the {% icon galaxy-pencil %} **pencil icon** for the dataset to edit its attributes
>    * In the central panel, click on the {% icon galaxy-gear %} **Convert** tab on the top
>    * Select `Convert CSV to tabular`
>    * Click the **Convert datatype** button
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment

{: .hands_on}


## Remove header

> ### {% icon comment %} Search bar
>
> Different Galaxy servers may have tools available under different sections, therefore it is often useful to use the **search bar** at the top of the tool panel to find your tool.
>
> Additionally different servers may have multiple, similarly named tools which accomplish similar functions. For these tutorials, you should select precisely the one that is described. However, in your real analyses, you'll need to search among the various options to find the one that works for you.

# Analysis: How to differentiate the different Iris species?

Our objective is to find what differentiate the different Iris species. We know that we have **3** species of iris flowers, with
**50** samples for each:
- setosa,
- versicolor,
- virginica.

These species look very much alike as shown on the figure below.

![3 species of Iris flowers](../../images/iris_flowers.png "3 species of Iris flowers")

And our objective is to find out whether the features we have been given for each species can help us to highlight the differences between the 3 species.

In our dataset, we have the following features measured for each sample:
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Sepal length
- Sepal width

## Visualize Iris dataset with **Scatterplot w ggplot2**

Let's visualize the Iris dataset to see how the features depend on each other, and 
check whether we can spot any immediate patterns.

>    - *"Column to plot on y-axis"*: `2`
>    - *"Plot title"*: `Sepal length as a function of sepal width`
>    - *"Label for x axis"*: `Sepal length`
>    - *"Label for y axis"*: `Sepal width`
>    - In *"Advanced Options"*:

>            - *"relative size of points"*: `2.0`
>        - *"Plotting multiple groups"*: `Plot multiple groups of data on one plot`
>            - *"column differentiating the different groups"*: `5`

# Share your work

One of the most important features of Galaxy comes at the end of an analysis. When you have published striking findings, it is important that other researchers are able to reproduce your in-silico experiment. Galaxy enables users to easily share their workflows and histories with others.

To share a history, click on the {% icon galaxy-gear %} icon in the history panel and select `Share or Publish`. On this page you can do 3 things:

1. **Make History Accessible via Link**. This generates a link that you can give out to others. Anybody with this link will be able to view your history.
2. **Make History Accessible and Publish**. This will not only create a link, but will also publish your history. This means your history will be listed under `Shared Data â†’ Histories` in the top menu.
3. **Share with a user**. This will share the history only with specific users on the Galaxy instance.

> ### {% icon comment %} Permissions
> Different servers have different default permission settings. Some servers create all of your datasets completely private to you, while others make them accessible if you know the secret ID.
>
> Be sure to select **Also make all objects within the History accessible** whenever you make a history accessible via link, otherwise whomever you send your link to might not be able to see your history.
{: .comment}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Share history and workflow
>
> 1. Share one of your histories with your neighbour.
> 2. See if you can do the same with your workflow!
> 3. Find the history and/or workflow shared by your neighbour. Histories shared with specific users can be accessed by those users in their {% icon galaxy-gear %} history menu under `Histories shared with me`.
