# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

This practical aims to familiarize you with the Galaxy user interface. 
It will teach you how to perform basic tasks such as importing data, running tools, working with histories, creating workflows, and sharing your work.
Not everyone has the same background and that's ok!

## What does Galaxy look like?

The Galaxy interface consists of three main parts:

1. The available tools are listed on the left
2. Your analysis history is recorded on the right
3. The central panel will let you run analyses and view outputs

![Galaxy ecosystem]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link shared/images/galaxy_interface.png %})


# Create a history

Galaxy allows you to create histories. They gather all the operations performed on certain datasets in order to achieve the desired results. 
Overall a history represents an experimental lab book, or a recipe very much like a cooking recipe with a list of ingredients (datasets) and a set of instructions 
(pipeline of operations) that describes how to prepare or make something (such as a plot, or even a new dataset).
The order of operations is important as very often the next operation takes as input the result of the previous operations. For instance, when baking
a cake, you would first sift flour and then mix it with eggs as it would be impossible to sift flour afterwards.
That is what we call a pipeline.

Then the finalized pipeline can be serialized as a workflow.A workflow is the concatenation of one or multiple histories as a series of building blocks 
for replicating an experimental result or a recipe. If we use cooking as an analogy, a workflow could represent an entire menu with all the recipes for each meal.
In other words, using a workflow makes it possible to apply the same procedure to a different dataset, just by changing the input.

## Upload Iris dataset

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Data upload
>
> 1. Import `iris.csv` from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1319069/files/iris.csv) or from the data library (ask your instructor)
>
>    ```
>    https://zenodo.org/record/1319069/files/iris.csv
>    ```
>
>    {% include snippets/import_via_link.md %}
>    {% include snippets/import_from_data_library.md %}
>
>    As default, Galaxy takes the link as name, so rename them.
>
> 2. Rename the dataset to `iris`
>
>    {% include snippets/rename_dataset.md %}
>
> 3. Check the datatype. The datatype of the iris dataset is `csv`. Change datatype
> if it is different then `csv`.
>
>    {% include snippets/change_datatype.md datatype="datatypes" %}
>
> 4. Add the tag `iris` to the dataset
>
>    {% include snippets/add_tag.md %}

# Pre-processing

A pre-processing step can be required to proceed analysis. In this case, format convertion and header removal have to be processed.


## Convert dataset **csv_to_tabular**

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Task description
>
> 1. **csv_to_tabular** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:

>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment

>    > * Click on the {% icon galaxy-pencil %} **pencil icon** for the dataset to edit its attributes
>    > * In the central panel, click on the {% icon galaxy-gear %} **Convert** tab on the top
>    > * Select `Convert CSV to tabular`
>    > * Click the **Convert datatype** button

## Remove header

> 1. **Remove header** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>
>    ***TODO***: *Check parameter descriptions*
>
>    ***TODO***: *Consider adding a comment or tip box*

>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment

# What does the dataset contain?

Now we are going to inspect the dataset and count the number of different species and how many sample by species are present in the dataset.

## How many different species are in the dataset?

## How many sample for each species?

# Title of the section usually corresponding to a big step in the analysis

It comes first a description of the step: some background and some theory.
Some image can be added there to support the theory explanation:

![Alternative text](../../images/image_name "Legend of the image")

The idea is to keep the theory description before quite simple to focus more on the practical part.

***TODO***: *Consider adding a detail box to expand the theory*

> ### {% icon details %} More details about the theory
