# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

This tutorial is a work in progress.

This practical aims to familiarize you with the Galaxy user interface. 
It will teach you how to perform basic tasks such as importing data, 
running tools, working with histories, 
creating workflows, and sharing your work.

#Create a new history

Galaxy allows you to create histories.
They are the pipeline of operations performed on a certain dataset in order to achieve the desired result.
After that your pipeline has been tested and leads to the correct result, 
it can be serialized as a workflow.
A workflow allows to obtain the same result with a different dataset, just by changing the input.

Overall a history represent and experimental lab book, or a recipe. 
A workflow is the concatenation of one or multiple histories as a series of building blocks 
for replicating an experimetal result or a recipe.

## Import data journals from the Galaxy publishing library

# Count the number of journals by... 

It comes first a description of the step: some background and some theory.
Some image can be added there to support the theory explanation:

![Alternative text](../../images/image_name "Legend of the image")

The idea is to keep the theory description before quite simple to focus more on the practical part.

***TODO***: *Consider adding a detail box to expand the theory*

> ### {% icon details %} More details about the theory
>
> But to describe more details, it is possible to use the detail boxes which are expandable
>
{: .details}

A big step can have several subsections or sub steps:


## Sub-step with **My Tool**

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Task description
>
> 1. **My Tool** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input file"*: File
>    - *"Parameter"*: `a value`
>
>    ***TODO***: *Check parameter descriptions*
>
>    ***TODO***: *Consider adding a comment or tip box*
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment
>    >
>    > A comment about the tool or something else. This box can also be in the main text
>    {: .comment}
>
{: .hands_on}

***TODO***: *Consider adding a question to test the learners understanding of the previous exercise*

> ### {% icon question %} Questions
>
> 1. Question1?
> 2. Question2?

## Re-arrange

To create the template, each step of the workflow had its own subsection.

***TODO***: *Re-arrange the generated subsections into sections or other subsections.
Consider merging some hands-on boxes to have a meaningful flow of the analyses*
