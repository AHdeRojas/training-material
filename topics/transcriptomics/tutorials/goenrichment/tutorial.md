# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

When we have a large list of genes of interest (for example, a list of differentially expressed genes obtained from an RNA-Seq experiment), how do we extract biological meaning from that list?

One way is to perform functional enrichment analysis. This method consists of the application of statistical tests to verify if genes of interest are more often associated to certain biological functions than what would be expected in a random set of genes. In this tutorial you will learn about enrichment analysis and how to perform it.

**What is the Gene Ontology?** <br/>
The [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org/) (GO) is a structured, controlled vocabulary and classification of gene function at the molecular and cellular level. It is divided in three separate sub-ontologies or GO types: biological process (e.g., signal transduction), molecular function (e.g., ATPase activity) and cellular component (e.g., ribosome). These sub-ontologies are structured as directed acyclic graphs (a hierarchy with multi-parenting) of GO terms.

**What are GO annotations?** <br/>
Genes are associated to GO terms via GO annotations. Each gene can have multiple annotations, even of the same GO type. An important notion to take into account when using GO is that, according to the **true path rule**, a gene annotated to a term is also implicitly annotated to each ancestor of that term in the GO graph. GO annotations have evidence codes that encode the type of evidence supporting them: only a small minority of genes have experimentally verified  annotations; the large majority have annotations inferred electronically based on sequence homology or known patterns.

# Functional Enrichment Analysis

To perform functional enrichment analysis, we need to have:
- A set of genes of interest (e.g., differentially expressed genes): **study set**
- A set with all the genes to consider in the analysis: **population set** (which must contain the study set)
- GO annotations, associating the genes in the population set to GO terms
- The GO ontology, with the description of GO terms and their relationships
 
For each GO term, we need to count the frequency (**k**) of genes in the study set (**n**) that are associated to the term, and the frequency (**K**) of genes in the population set (**N**) that are associated to the same term. Then we test how likely would it be to obtain at least **k** genes associated to the term if **n** genes would be randomly sampled from the population, given the frequency **K** and size **N** of the population.

The appropriate statistical test is the one-tailed variant of Fisherâ€™s exact test, also known as the hypergeometric test for over-representation. When the one-tailed version is applied, this test will compute the probability of observing at least the sample frequency, given the population frequency.  The [hypergeometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution) measures precisely the probability of **k** successes in **n** draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size **N** that contains exactly **K** successful objects:

For this first exercise we will use data from [Trapnell et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22383036 "Trapnell et al. data"). In this work, the authors created an artificial dataset of gene expression in *Drosophila melanogaster*, where 300 random genes were set (insilico) to be differentially expressed between two conditions.

# Simplification of graphs

Graphs views are essential, but sometimes the graph view can become overwhelming due to the size of the results. To exemplify this issue, we will next perform functional enrichment analysis using a more realistic dataset from a study using the mouse model organism. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE30352). In this [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10532), the authors compared the gene expression of several tissues. Here, we will use results from the comparison between heart and brain.

As you may notice, the number of enriched GO Terms is very high, with graphs that are too extensive to analyze manually. And this is despite the fact that GOEnrichment ignores singletons and skips dependent tests by default precisely to avoid enrichment results that are too extensive and not informative. 

The Summarize Output option in the GOEnrichment tool addresses this problem by conflating branches/families of enriched GO terms and selecting the most representative term(s) from them (usually 1-2 term per family). The greatly simplifies the results while retaining branch information, and thus ensuring that every enriched family of functions is present in the results. Some specificity is necessarily lost, but the trade-off is that the results become easier and more intuitive to analyze.

>    >
>    > <summary>Click to view answers</summary>
>    > 1. Yes, there are differences. As you can see, the activation of the Summarize option reduces the size of the graph because this parameter causes families of GO terms to be conflated. Each major branch in the full results is still present in the summarized results, but now is reduced to 1 or 2 most representative terms, leading to a graph that is much easier to interpret while still containing all the key functional information.

>    {: .question}

Another approach to reduce the complexity of the results is to use a shallower version of GO, the GO slims. GO slims are transversal cuts of GO that cover all key branches but lack specific terms. Thus, using them leads to much simpler results than using the full GO, but also leads to a substantial loss in specificity, which is greater than that of the Summarize Output option. 

To test the GO slim approach, let us use the mouse dataset again. First, however, we need to use GOSlimmer tool to convert the annotations file from full GO to GO slim (as GO annotations are typically made to terms that are too specific to be in the GO slim, and thus need to be extended by the true path rule).

Now we will go use the GOEnrichment tool with the new Slim Annotations file and the same study set.

>    > 1. The differences that you observe is due to the ontology used. When we apply the summarize option with the full GO, the GOEnrichment tool will return a summarized output (as we have seen previously). When we opted for GO Slim, the original annotation was already summarized, resulting in an even more summarized output, but with a consequent loss of specificity.

# Interpretation of the results
The interpretation of the results will depend on the biological information that we intend to extract. Enrichment analysis can be used in validation (e.g., of a protocol for extracting membrane proteins), characterization (e.g., of the effects of a stress in a organism) and elucidation (e.g., of the functions impacted by the knock-out of a transcription factor).

There is one important point to keep in mind during the analysis: statistically significant is different from biologically meaningful. That said, it is typically possible to obtain some biological or technical insight about the underlying experiment from statistically enriched terms, even if it isnâ€™t readily apparent.

Terms that are very generic tend to be difficult to interpret, because the meaning they convey is shallow. On the other hand, very specific terms are generally not integrative and thus not useful in interpreting a gene set collectively. The interesting terms are those that are sufficiently specific to transmit substantial biological meaning, yet generic enough to integrate multiple genes.
 
For the second exercice, we will continue to work with the same study set as before but now we analyze separately genes that are over- and the under-expressed, and see the enriched GO terms presents in the brain and heart from the mouse.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}
Functional enrichment is a good way to look for patterns in gene lists, but interpretation of results can become a complicated process. One way to reduce this complexity is to use the GOEnrichment tool. This tool not only performs the GO Enrichment test, showing us enriched GO terms from our sets, but also contains functionality to simplify the results and make them more easily interpretable. Independently of this, we need to be careful when choosing our genes of interest, but also the background set of genes against which we want to compare.
