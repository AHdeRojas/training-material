# Runaway Storage

Tips:
- Set quotas
- `tmpwatch` your job working directory
  - `cleanup_job` in `galaxy.yml` (defaults to `always` though)
- Set up dataset cleanup

---
# Dataset Cleanup

- `scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py`: PostgreSQL-optimized fast cleanup script
- `scripts/cleanup_datasets/cleanup_datasets.py`: General cleanup script
- `gxadmin cleanup 30`: calls pgcleanup

# Dataset Cleanup Lifecycle

Mark deleted all "anonymous" histories not used within the last `$days` days:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s delete_userless_histories`

Remove all history exports older than `$days` days:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s delete_exported_histories`

Mark purged HDAs in histories deleted `$days` or more days ago (not user-recoverable):

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s purge_deleted_histories`

---
# Dataset Cleanup Lifecycle

Mark purged individual HDAs deleted `$days` or more days ago (not user-recoverable):

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s purge_deleted_hdas`

Mark datasets with all purged HDAs last updated `$days` or more days ago deleted:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s delete_datasets`

Mark purged all datasets last updated `$days` or more days ago **and remove from disk**:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s purge_datasets`

# Nagios

General purpose tool for monitoring systems and services.

Galaxy-specific check in `contrib/nagios/`: Runs Galaxy jobs

---

# Sentry

* Motto: *"Stop hoping your users will report errors"*
* Error tracking and analysing tool.
* Galaxy has Sentry middleware that you can enable in configuration.

---

# Backups

What to back up:
- Configs (done with Ansible)
- Database
- Installed shed tools and dependencies
- Datasets (if you can...)

What not to back up:

- Anything in `database/` not mentioned above
- Job working directories
