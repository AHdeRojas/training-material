## Part of the Job

- We are not just janitors / code monkeys
	- We're humans with feelings
	- Our users are humans with feelings as well
	- Both groups must be understanding of each other
- We're (often) the point of contact for any problems
	- It's our responsibilty to fix Galaxy problems
	- Or any server problems for our usres
	- Of sometimes anything that is electrical is our problem

## SLAs and SLOs

- Academic services rarely have SLAs
- But define your own SLO (and agree on it with your boss)
- Freedom to say "it's ok, it will be down for some time"

---

## Bad things happen

- It's unavoidable
	- Network
	- DC
	- Server
	- Service
- Be kind to your fellow admins, maybe it's their turn to have a bad day
- Spend time engineering to avoid problems
	- But consider the system's SLA/SLO

---

## Communication

- Communication *Communication* **Communication**
	- The most important thing, for improving relations with users
- Users often just want to know when the service will be back, or that their jobs are still running
	- So write helpful notifications before, during, after planned outages
	- [Write posts after unplanned outages](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2018/09/21/downtime/)
	- [Add graphics](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2018/07/12/workflow-outage/)

### Shared Responsibility

- You are maybe not the only person maintaining your server
- You will probably change jobs, and someone else will maintain your code
- Document *Document* **Document** your code/infrastructure/everything
- Someone else will debug your code at 3 am and hate you
	- You've probably had to do the same with someone else's code
	- Write code to be read by humans first, and machines second

### Small Changes have Big Impacts

Be careful with what changes you make in production; all of your users are depending on you to do their work

Small changes affect 10s-1000s of people
