## Why study the microbiome?

.pull-left[

- Health care research
 - Humans are full of microorganisms
 - Skin, gut, oral cavity, nasal cavity, eyes, ..
 - Affects health, drug efficacy, etc

]

- Sometimes referred to as your **second genome**
 - ~10 times more cells than you
 - ~100 times more genes than you
 - ~1000s different species

## Why study the microbiome?

- Environmental studies
  - Microbes in the soil affect plants and animals
  - Improve agriculture

## Cellulose Degradation in a Biogas Reactor

![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/experimental_setup.png)



???

A 100 µl aliquot of an enriched community from a biogas reactor was transferred to 27 anaerobic bottles containing a rich medium and 10g/L of cellulose as sole carbon source and incubated at 65 °C.

Three bottles were collected at 9 different time points (0, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38 and 43 h) and processed in triplicates. Metatranscriptomic analysis was performed on all time points. Metaproteomics analysis on 4 data points.

## Preprocessing

In this tutorial we start with some preprocessing steps

- Quality Control with **FastQC** and **MultiQC**
- Trimming and Filtering with **Cutadapt**
- Filter ribosomal RNA with **SortMeRNA**
- Interlace FastQ files

---

### FastQC

- Generate a web report with quality metrics of your FastQ file

![](../../../sequence-analysis/images/fastqc-report.png)

---

### MultiQC

.pull-left[
- Combine multiple FastQC reports into one report

- Also for outputs of other tools

- Great when sequencing large numbers of samples

### Read Trimming and Filtering

- Remove adapters
- Trim low-quality bases from reads
- Filter reads based on length, quality, ..
- Many tools that do this: CutAdapt, TrimGalore, ..

---

### SortMeRNA

.pull-left[
- Most RNA sequences will be ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

- Great for taxonomical assignment (who is there?)

- Not informative for functional analysis (What are they doing?)

- Filter out rRNA before doing functional analysis
