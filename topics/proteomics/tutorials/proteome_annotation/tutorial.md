# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

[ProteoRE Galaxy instance](http://www.proteore.org) provides necessary tools to execute a whole annotation pipeline of a protein list identified by LC-MS/MS experiments. This activity introduces these tools and guides you through a simple pipeline using some example datasets based on the following study: [Proteomic characterization of human exhaled breath condensate] {% cite Lacombe2018 %}.
The goal of this study was to identify proteins secreted in the respiratory tract (lung, bronchi). Samples were obtained non-invasively by condensation of exhaled air that contains submicron droplets of airway lining fluid. Two pooled samples of EBC, each obtained from 10 healthy donors, were processed. Two 'technical' control samples were processed in parallel to the pooled samples to correct for exogenous protein contamination. 
A total of 229 unique proteins were identified in EBC among which 153 proteins were detected in both EBC pooled samples. A detailed bioinformatics analysis of these 153 proteins showed that most of the proteins identified corresponded to proteins secreted in the respiratory tract (lung, bronchi).

# Filtering out technical contaminants

A group of 10 proteins were identified in both “technical” control samples with an enrichment in EBC samples below a fixed threshold. These proteins were thus considered to be technical contaminants (see list of proteins in Table 4 in {% cite Lacombe2018 %}) and have to be removed from the initial dataset.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove the contaminants
>
> 1. **Filter by keywords and/or numerical value** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input file"*: `Lacombe_et_al_2017.txt` (Input dataset)
>    - Keep default option `Yes` for *"Does file contain header?"*
>    - *"Operation"*: `Discard`. We want to remove technical contaminants.
>    - Keep the `OR` option (by default) for the **operator** parameter. We don't need that parameter for a single filter.
>    - First add a  {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Filter by keywords"* box with a list of keywords to be filtered out.   In this case, keywords are list of Uniprot accession numbers.
>    - The *"Column number on which to apply the filter"*, in this case is the column that contains Uniprot accession numbers (`c1` as by default).
>    - *"Search for exact match ?"* You can perform exact or partial match with the keywords entered. Partial match is set by default. We keep default option `No` in this tutorial.
>    - To *"Enter keywords"*, you can either copy and paste list of keywords to the text area or choose a file that contains keywords in text format, in which each lines contains a keyword. Here we choose to `copy/paste` the following list of Uniprot accession number `P04264 P35908 P13645 Q5D862 Q5T749 Q8IW75 P81605 P22531 P59666 P78386`

# Check for the presence of biological contaminants

As EBC samples are obtained from air exhaled through the oral cavity, and even though the RTube collection device contained a saliva trap to separate saliva from the exhaled breath, contamination with salivary proteins had to be assessed. We decided to check the expression pattern for each protein of the "core" EBC proteome using the [The Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) (HPA, {% cite Uhln2005 %}). As HPA is indexed by Ensembl gene identifier (ENSG) we first need to convert Uniprot ID to Ensembl gene (ENSG). Secondly, check for proteins which are highly expressed in the salivary glands as reported by HPA, then in a third step, we filter out these proteins.

We thus will remove these biological contaminants from our initial protein set.

# Functional annotation of the EBC proteome (enrichment analysis)

The resulting list of 157 proteins identified in the two pooled EBC samples (excluding the 10 contaminants proteins) is now submitted to Gene Ontology (GO)-term enrichment analysis to determine functions that were significantly enriched in our EBC proteomic dataset compared to the lung proteome (corresponding to tissue-specific genes extracted from the Human Protein Atlas). To do so, we first build a lung reference proteome (that should be more representative of the studied sample rather than a full human proteome) that will be used for enrichment analysis performed with the ClusterProfiler tool (based on the R package clusterProfiler).

As the ClusterProfiler tool (which we will use for the enrichment analysis) does not consider ENSG (Ensembl gene) identifiers as input, we need to convert IDs into either entrez Gene ID or Uniprot accession number.

# Visualize EBC proteome on biological pathways (using Reactome)

The 157 proteins identified in EBC samples are now mapped to biological pathways and visualized
via the web service of Reactome, an open access, manually curated and peer-reviewed human pathway

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

ProteoRE offers a panel of tools to annotate a protein list. 
We showed that it is possible to make ID conversion, perform tissu-expression annotation, but also 
Gene Ontology analysis as well as Reactome interogation. 
This allows the user to go deeper in the analysis of proteomics analyses results.
