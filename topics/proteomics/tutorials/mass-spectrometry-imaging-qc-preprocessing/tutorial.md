# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Preprocessing and peak detection are key steps for the analysis of mass spectrometry imaging data as they help to base the following statistical analysis on real peaks rather than on noise peaks. Several preprocessing steps have to be performed in order to prepare the mass spectra for peak picking, this includes spectra smoothing and baseline removal. Intensity values need to be normalized by transformation and spectra wide calibration. Then peak detection is performed, peak isotopes are removed and only peaks that occur in a decent number of spectra are kept.

# Preparing the spectra for peak detection

Several preprocessing steps are necessary to improve the performance of the peak detection step: 
  1. Transformation
  2. Smoothing
  3. Baseline removal
  4. SPectra wise calibration
  5. Warping/m/z calibration

TODO: provide test files; probably many m/z can be cut off to have a nice image with many pixels but not many m/z left?! Provide information only after QC - murine kidney etc...m/z are cut...Hauptfrage: Wie krÃ¼ppelig sind unsere einzelnen Spektren in der Niere?

# Any follow up??? 

To read and extract information from MSI data files special tools are needed. The imzML exporter provides the option to export spectra, feature and intensity data from imzML or Analyze7.5
files into tabular files. This may be helpful to follow up on interesting aspects of the quality report with exact values. Standard statistical programmes and software to perform further plots are normally compatible with tabular files. Care has to be taken, that  In case the intensity matrix of an unprocessed file is exported the tabular file will be huge and it might happen that 


- spectra output: spectra in rows - for each spectrum: name, x and y coordinates,order, number of peaks (intensities > 0), total ion chromatogram (TIC), highest m/z feature per spectrum, optional count of input m/z per spectrum, optional spectrum annotation
- mz feature output: m/z in rows - for each m/z: name, m/z, mean, median, standard deviation (sd), standard error of the mean (sem), sum of all intensities per m/z, number of peaks (intensity > 0) per m/z

Bsp tables spectra, feature and int. matrix information???

# Concluding remarks
{:.no_toc}

- imzML (continuous or processed file type) and Analyze7.5 can be uploaded into Galaxy via the composite upload. 
- The MSI quality report should be applied several times in the analysis pipeline and especially to control that the preprocessing is going well. (Link preprocessing tutorial)
- The MSI imzML exporter can be used any time during the analysis when it is necessary to dig deeper into the data. Galaxy provides many text manipulation tools that can directly be applied on the exported tabular file to filter, sort, plot, ... the data.
