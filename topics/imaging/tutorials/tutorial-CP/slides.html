title: Nucleoli segmentation <br> & <br> feature extraction <br> using CellProfiler
zenodo_link: ''
questions:
- How do I run an image analysis pipeline on public data using CellProfiler?
- How do I analyse the DNA channel of fluorescence siRNA screens?
- How do I download public image data into my history?
- How do I segment and label cell nuclei?
- How do I segment nucleoli (as the absence of DNA)?
- How do I combine nuclei and nucleoli into one segmentation mask?
- How do I extract the background of an image?
- How do I relate the nucleoli to their parent nucleus?
- How do I measure the image and object features?
- How do I measure the image quality?
objectives:
- How to download images from a public image repository.
- How to segment cell nuclei using CellProfiler in Galaxy.
- How to segment cell nucleoli using CellProfiler in Galaxy.
- How to extract features for images, nuclei and nucleoli.
time_estimation: 4H
key_points:
- Galaxy workflows can download images from the IDR, selecting specific channels, time points, z-stack positions and crop the image in different ways.
- CellProfiler in Galaxy can segment and extract features of any object of interest.
- The features and masks can be exported for further analysis.

### What is the nucleoli?

- Large structure in the nucleus
- Membrane-less organelle
- Functions: ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation

### Data

- Bring your own images: upload DNA channel images to your Galaxy history
- Download from the Image Data Resource ([IDR](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/))

---


### 1) Segment nuclei

### 2) Segment nucleoli

### Combined mask: nuclei + nucleoli
