questions:
  - "What is machine learning?"
  - "Why is it useful?"
  - "What are its different approaches?"
objectives:
  - "Provide the basics of machine learning and its variants."
  - "Learn how to make predictions using the training and test data."
  - "Classify data using a Galaxy workflow."
requirements:
time_estimation: "1/2h"
key_points:
  - "Machine learning algorithms learn features from data."
  - "It is used for multiple tasks like classification, regression, clustering and so on."
  - "For the classification task, data is divided into training and test sets."
  - "Each data sample in training and test sets has a category/class."

### Machine learning

- Analyze data. 
- Perform tasks like classification, clustering and many more.

### Variants of machine learning

- Multiple types of machine learning.
- Depends on nature of data and kind of analysis.

### Prediction

- Divide data into training and test sets.
- Learn on training set and predict on test set.

### Classification: An example (1/4)

- Upload a dataset (available at [EpistasisLab](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks/blob/master/datasets/classification/titanic/titanic.tsv.gz)).
- The last column is a category/class.

### Classification: An example (2/4)

- Use a Galaxy tool (Support vector machine (SVM)) as a classifier.

- Create a workflow with an input dataset and the classifier.

### Classification: An example (3/4)

- Run the workflow.
