---

### Basics

- A machine learning algorithm learns features from the data
- To predict, it learns features using training data
- It predicts using the test data
- Machine learning can - predict, cluster, reduce data dimensionality, regress on continuous, numerical data and much more

### Classification: An example (1/4)

- Upload a dataset 
- The last column is a category/class

---

### Classification: An example (2/4)

- Use a Galaxy tool (Support vector machine (SVM)) as a classifier

- Create a workflow with an input dataset and the classifier
