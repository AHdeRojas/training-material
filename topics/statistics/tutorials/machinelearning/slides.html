questions:
  - "What is machine learning?"
  - "Why is it useful?"
  - "What are its different approaches?"
objectives:
  - "Provide the basics of machine learning and its variants."
  - "Learn how to make predictions using the training and test data."
  - "Classify data using a Galaxy workflow."
requirements:
time_estimation: "1/2h"
key_points:
  - "Machine learning algorithms learn features from data."
  - "It is used for multiple tasks like classification, regression, clustering and so on."
  - "For the classification task, data is divided into training and test sets."
  - "Each data sample in training and test sets has a category/class."
  - "Many learning tasks can be performed on datasets using Galaxy tools for machine learning."

### Machine learning

- Analyze data. 
- Perform tasks like classification, clustering and many more.

### Variants of machine learning

- Multiple types of machine learning.
- Depends on nature of data and kind of analysis.

### Prediction

- Divide data into training and test sets.
- Learn on training set and predict on test set.

### Classification: An example (1/6)

- Upload a dataset "iris_train.csv" (available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1404173)).
- The dataset contains information about Iris flowers.
- The first four columns give the width and length of sepals and petals of Iris flowers.
- The last column is a category/class and shows the types of Iris flowers.

### Classification: An example (2/6)

- Open "Support vector machines" tool present in "statistics" tool category and update its parameters

---

### Classification: An example (3/6)

- Execute the tool.
- See the trained model dataset as ```h5``` file in the history.

### Classification: An example (4/6)

- Upload test dataset "iris_test.csv" (available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1404173)).
- It does not contain the category column.

### Classification: An example (5/6)

- Open the same classifier but set the classification task as "load a model and predict".
