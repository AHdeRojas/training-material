### Classification: An example (1/4)

- Upload a dataset (available at [EpistasisLab](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks/blob/master/datasets/classification/titanic/titanic.tsv.gz)).
- The last column is a category/class.

### Classification: An example (2/4)

- Use a Galaxy tool (Support vector machine (SVM)) as a classifier.

- Create a workflow with an input dataset and the classifier.
