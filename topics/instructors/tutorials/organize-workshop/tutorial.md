# Checklists

These recommendations are highly inspired from the one by [The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html)

## Before the workshop

1. Discuss with the instructors to decide on the curriculum 
2. Set dates for the workshop
3. Try to choose a good venue

    A good venue is crucial to establishing a positive learning environment. Some things to consider include:

    - Tables arranged so participants can watch the instructor, use their laptops, and talk with their peers
      
      Fold up desks are usually not a good choice.

      An even better solution is a computer room.

    - Tables arranged so helpers and instructors can easily walk around the room
    - A room with a projector and screen that everyone can see, with HDMI, VGA, and Mac adapters to allow anyone to plug in their laptop
    - Hi speed wifi internet access that can withstand everyone using it together
    - High table or podium that instructor can stand at while teaching
    
      A flat podium is important; itâ€™s difficult to use a laptop on a slanted podium

    - Black/white board

4. Ensure your location is accessible

    It's important to make sure the workshop space is accessible to all individuals. The registration form should ask whether instructors, helpers, and learners need any advance arrangements to ensure they can participate in the event. This may include considering whether or not:

    - Building and room are accessible to those who can not use stairs (ramps, elevators, etc.)
    - Restrooms are accessible
    - There is a microphone for instructors
    - The screen is large enough and bright enough to be easily read
    - The building and room can accommodate service animals
    - Lactation space is provided

5. Create a registration form

    1. Decide if there is a workshop fee

      Even a small fee can greatly reduce the no-show rate. 
    
    2. Registration form: Google or Eventbrite if fee

      Example of regular questions

    3. Ask if participation to social events (if there is)

6. Create a small webpage with all the information about the workshop

    Ideally, such a page should include:
    1. General presentation
    2. Registration information
    2. Schedule with topics, presenters and helpers, start / end, links to material (latter) for each day
    3. Location of the venue with extra information
      1. Map
      2. Lunch options around
      3. Accomodation options around
    4. Organizers

    It can be easily done on the [Galaxy Community Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/) or usegalaxy.eu, on GitHub

7. Advertise your workshop on the Galaxy Hub and usegalaxy.*

    PR / Issue template for training events?

8. Make travel arrangements for visiting instructors (or communicate process to reimburse them for expenses)
9. Collect emergency contact information for instructors in case of last minute changes
10. Arrange required materials and equipment

    - Power outlets for all participants
    
      This may include setting up extension cords or power strips

    - Sticky notes in two contrasting colors
    - Name tags to help people get to know each other
    - Extra pens and paper in case people want to take notes by hand
    - Sign in sheets
    - Pens for black/white board

11. Arrange for coffee/tea, snacks, and/or lunch

    We all learn better with fuel!

12. Test the projector with a different computers
13. Contact participants to remind them of workshop location, timing
14. Contact instructors and help to remind them of workshop location, timing
15. Make a reservation for a social dinner

## During the workshop

1. Introduce the workshop
    1. Explain the emergency plan
    2. Explain the schedule
    3. Point out the lunch options
    4. Organize a icebreaker (bingo sheet, for example) and ask for the data needs

        Everything is about networking!

2. Ensure that the room is set up with all necessary materials and equipment
3. Periodically check in on the class to be sure things are running smoothly
4. Contact the participants to remind them it's happening / what the schedule is / what's going on the next day
5. Prepare and hand-in the participation certificates

## After the workshop

1. Collect workshop attendance
2. Reimburse the instructors
3. Update the website with the link to the material
4. Collect feedback form and analyze them with the instructors
5. Contact the participants with the links to the materials
