# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

This guide gives you a list of things you might want to do to prepare for giving a training for the first time. This assumes:

- You are leading the training
- You have previously given trainings and are somewhat comfortable with that
- This is the first time you've given this training
- You will have someone else with you who is more experienced and can answer the tough questions

# Before the Training:

- Read through the slides
    - Think of what you will say on each slide
    - Add speaker notes to the slides if they're missing
- Go through the hands on
    - Read all of the sections

      You want to learn all of the steps well, the flow of the data, etc. You
      will not know everything about the topic, you'll probably encounter
      things you won't know or understand, take some time to google these
      things and learn about these topics. Any questions you have, the
      participants might have as well.

    - Do all of the hands on boxes (in the production environment)
- Go through hands on again, you probably do not need to do the hands-on
  sections on subsequent times, until you feel comfortable that you understand
  the flow of the data from step to step, the overall sections (e.g. QC,
  Filtering, ... )
