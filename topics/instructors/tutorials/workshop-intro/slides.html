]

.footnote[*your sticky notes may be different colours | [back to start](#start)]

???
Get two different coloured sticky notes, and give one of each
to each of the participants

**Pink/red/orange:** Have learners put this on their screen if they
get stuck and would like a helper to come over. This will save
them having to keep their hand raised if all helpers are busy.

**Green/Yellow:** You might give an assignment ("do this section on your own",
"try to answer this question box with your neighbour") and want to continue centrally
afterwards. By asking participants to put up the sticky when they are done,
you will have a sense of when most of your learners are ready to continue.

**Request:**
 - Collect all sticky notes and add them to [this github issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989)
   after the workshop to share the feedback and ideas for improvements with the GTN community.
 - Add any feedback received from instructors and helpers here as well
 - [Example feedback post](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989#issuecomment-493642457)

name:audience

# Get to know our audience

- What is your background knowledge and experience?
- Next will be a series of yes/no questions
- Answer by holding up a sticky note
- There are no wrong answers!

{% include topics/instructors/tutorials/workshop-intro/yesno.md %}

.footnote[[back to start](#start) | [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
- Do this after introducing the concept of sticky notes if you use them.
- If not using sticky notes, merely ask learners to raise their hands
  if their answer is "yes"
- following slides are a series of questions you could ask, not all will
  be relevant for you, but ask your own tailored questions too
