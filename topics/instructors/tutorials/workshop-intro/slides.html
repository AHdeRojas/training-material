# Introduce yourself

.left-column70[
- For example:
  - Who are you?
  - Where are you from?
  - What do you do?
  - Why did you join this workshop?
  - What experience do you have with the topics of this workshop?
]

.right-column30[
.image-90[![](../../images/workshop-intro/introductions.jpg)]
]

.footnote[[back to start](#start)]

???
Go around the room and have everybody introduce themself briefly. This is a good opportunity to get a better sense of the background of your audience.

These questions are just a guide

# Sticky Notes

.left-column70[
1. Status indicators
 - Green: Used to indicate your progress
 - Pink: Put on your screen if you need help

2. End-of-day feedback
 - Green: what did you like?
 - Pink: what could we improve tomorrow/next time?
 - Leave them on the whiteboard at the end of the day
]

]

.footnote[*your sticky notes may be different colours | [back to start](#start)]

???
Get two different coloured sticky notes, and give one of each to each of the participants

Pink/red/orange: Have learners put this on their screen if they get stuck and would like a helper to come over. This will save them having to keep their hand raised if all helpers are busy.

Green/Yellow: You might give an assignment ("do this section on your own") and want to discuss this centrally afterwards. By asking participants to put up the sticky when they are done you will have a sense of when most of your learners are ready to continue.

name:audience

# Get to know our audience

- We want to get an idea of your background knowledge and experience
- Next will be a series of yes/no questions
- There are no wrong answers!
- Answer by holding up a sticky note:

{% include topics/instructors/tutorials/workshop-intro/yesno.md %}

.footnote[[back to start](#start) or [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
- Do this after introducing the concept of sticky notes if you use them.
- If not using sticky notes, merely ask learners to raise their hands if answer is "yes"
- following slides are a series of questions you could ask, not all will be relevant for you, but ask your own tailored questions too
